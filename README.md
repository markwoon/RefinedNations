This is a userscript for Nations on MaBi Web.

Its goal is to maximize the amount of information displayed at once.  It will:

* Hide all extraneous UI/padding
* Show all player boards at once (can customize board order; defaults to player's board first, followed by boards in turn order)
* Always display resource production/total vp information (normally only displayed when hovering over resources)
* Integrate personal notes next to player board
* Adds a "Reload Page" button so you don't have to go back to the Game Manager when you finish your turn
* Ability to auto-reload page if it's your game, getting notifications when it's your turn (disabled by default)

To configure the script, go to the script's settings:

You should get a settings panel that looks like:

This has only been tested in Chrome and Tampermonkey.

Suggestions/contributions welcome.
